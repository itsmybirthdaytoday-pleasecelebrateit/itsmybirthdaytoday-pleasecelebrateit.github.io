    <h1>24-Year-Old Woman Reported Missing in West Lafayette</h1>
    <p class="timestamp">April 13, 2025 · By Natalie Greene</p>

    <p>Authorities in West Lafayette are searching for a 24-year-old woman who was reported missing late Sunday evening, just one day before her birthday.</p>

    <p>The woman, identified as <strong>Sarah Sallow</strong>, was last seen around 6:30 PM near Happy Hollow Park. Family members say she left home to take a short walk and never returned.</p>

    <p>“She said she just wanted some fresh air,” said her sister, Emily Sallow. “She always loved going for walks before her birthday. But she usually checks in within an hour. This time she didn’t.”</p>

    <p>Search and rescue teams, including local volunteers, began canvassing the area early Sunday morning. Authorities say there is no evidence of foul play at this time, but they are not ruling out any possibilities.</p>

    <p>Sarah was last seen wearing a blue jacket, jeans, and white sneakers. She is approximately 5'6", with dark brown hair and green eyes.</p>

    <p>“We just want her home safe,” said a friend. “Tomorrow would’ve been her birthday.”</p>
